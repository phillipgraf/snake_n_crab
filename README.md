# snake_n_crab
A simple snake  game. Eat the coconuts and you get a speed boost eat the crab and you will slow down.

This was my first Java project for the "Programming 1" course of my studies.

I know the folder structure is a bit crazy, but I'm too lazy to update it now. You can find the game in the path:  
Snake_n_Crab\game_led_module\source\Game
